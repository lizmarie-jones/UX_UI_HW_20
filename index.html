<h1>Case Study: Petla Animal Boarding App</h1>
<div class="container">
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p class="lead">Pet owners need flexibility and peace of mind while traveling.</p> <p>We designed an app to help pet owners find and manage pet boarding and other services, whether close to home or on the road.<br>
        Each member of our team was involved in every aspect of the four-week project with an emphasis on UX design. Our end result was a high-fidelity prototype and mockup of a pet boarding app's onboarding and service-booking processes.<br>
        <strong>Tools used:</strong> Miro, Paper and Pencil, Balsamiq Wireframes, Figma<br>

    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12"><p>Our project began with a veterinary clinic exploring whether to offer overnight pet boarding.<br> 
          We interviewed eight pet owners, focusing on their experiences, 
          values, and concerns around arranging care for their pets while traveling. They generally relied on family and friends 
          to watch their animals while they're away. The advantages of using these relationships included the assurance that their pet was in the 
          care of a familiar, trustworthy person. They also liked being able to check in and see how their pet was doing. Based on our research, we created a user persona, Megan, to keep potential users' needs top-of-mind.

        <h3> Definition & Synthesis</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><p>After more in-depth analysis, we determined that developing a platform to connect pet owners like Megan with reputable pet daycare and boarding providers would help them travel with greater confidence.
                Allowing Megan to search based on geography empowers her to find safe and trustworthy options whether she decide to leave her dog behind or bring him along.

            <h3> Ideation</h3>

                <div class="col-sm-6"><img src="images/kenneldog.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Image of a dog in an open kennel by Ayla Verschueren on Unsplash.">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6"><p>We found the platform needed to enable Megan to filter providers by additional criteria, including location, price point, 
                    and additional services offered. Since family and friends aren't always available to watch pets, we wanted to include reviews so that she could 
                    make informed decisions about who to entrust her dog with.

            <h3>Low-fi Prototyping</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12"><p>We conducted a competitor analysis to see what was already available and what gaps exist in this area. 
                    We developed a user flow to onboard new users and to find, select, and book desired services for a pet. 
                    We sketched out what this could look like on paper, and then refined those sketches into something we could run user tests with.</p>
                </div>

            <h3>User Testing & Outcomes</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6"><p>Based on test feedback, we revised the user flow to make the app easier to navigate. We then simplified and unified the messages and tone used throughout the app to create a more consistent experience. 
                    Input from our testers improved usability for the more complex features in the app. We incorporated these changes into a high-fidelity prototype and iOS mockups.

            <h3>Conclusion & Future Opportunities</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12"><p>The research process took us in an unexpected direction from our initial idea of what the app would be, teaching us the importance of conducting research and being open and flexible when developing solutions for users. 
                    As careful as we were in developing our designs, we still took a lot for granted in laying out the app, so user testing kept us on track through the development process. Through developing and refining our wireframes and prototypes, it became clear to us that all apps need constant maintenance and upgrades.
                    With further development and refinement, this app could address gaps in the pet care market and improve the experience of people who travel as well as that of their pets.</p>
